My research specialization is mobile computing. Currently, I am exploring the
ubiquitous system for smart agriculture.

Previously, I worked on mobile health for ubiquitous skin disease monitoring
and detection. The result has been published as an workshop paper in
DigiBiom 2022. This work is supervised by professor
[Yang Zhang](https://yangzhang.dev/) and supported by
[HiLab](https://hilab.dev/) at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu).
